Typical beginner repository

Hello all,

My name is Bryan. I am a student at university with an increasing interest in applications development (especially through the use of JVM compatible languages such as Java, Scala, & Kotlin). I hope that this will be a good jumping off point, as far as displaying some of my skills in programming through the creation of small, creative and fun projects. :)

PS: Take it easy on the moon tacos!
